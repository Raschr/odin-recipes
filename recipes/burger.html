        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to delicious meatless burgers.</p>
        <p>Mushrooms really give them a meaty flavor. I like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a little lettuce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="Recipes-list">
            <ul>
                <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
                <li>⅔ cup rolled oats</li>
                <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <div class="Recipes-list">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><Strong>Step 1</Strong></p>
                    <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms,
                    onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have
                    released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove
                    from the heat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><Strong>Step 2</Strong></p>
                    <p>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><Strong>Step 3</Strong></p>
                    <p>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread
                    crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in
                    Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have
                    absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture,
                    1/4 cup at a time, into patties.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><Strong>Step 5</Strong></p>
                    <p>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties
                    in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per
                    side.</p>
